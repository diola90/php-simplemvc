A very simple MVC programming pattern implementation on PHP

= Introduction =

This is designed to be simple and straight forward coding in MVC pattern. It doesn't require you to study loads of documentation. This framework will allow you to start coding immediately. 

Lightweight? It will even float in the air! This is as simple as coding pure PHP.


= Details =

*Requirements*
  * PHP5
  * Knowledgeable on MVC pattern
  * Subversion (used to checkout the files) http://tortoisesvn.net/downloads.html


*Setup*
  * Download http://php-simplemvc.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/
  * Remove all the sample codes.

*How to use*
*1.* To create a controller just inherit Controller class.
*2.* To invoke controller methods there should be a Post key with postfix "_action" or "action" (not a postfix). The value of that key will be the name of the method to be executed.
example 

<input type="text" name="data" id="data" value="1">

<input type="submit" name="submit_action" id="submit_action" value="MethodName">
.
.
.
class MyController extends Controller
{
  public MethodName ($data)
  {}
}
*3.* Parameters of the controller method should be the same name with the post data. 

<input type="text" name="data" id="data" value="1">
.
.
public MethodName ($data)
{}

*4.* Call Controller method PopulateRequest to where you post your data. If you post within the same page then put it there. If you post it to the control page then put it there.


$controller1 = new Sample2Controller();
.
.
$controller1->PopulateRequest ();

*5.* You should put the files accordingly (View, Model and Controller)

*6.* This is not a pure MVC so get over it!
